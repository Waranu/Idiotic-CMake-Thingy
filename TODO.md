- Create a section dedicated to listing which libs are supported by this. Which are but need more work. Which have bugs etc.
- Fix the inconsistent style of vars.  
- Creation of ```deps/``` and ```build/``` should be delegated to python script instead. 
- At this point, direct "vendored" stuff is better for libs that like IMGUI and NUKCLEAR or maybe not whole lib vendor but only those stuff that are "not present in the lib itself". 
- Should precompiled versions for vendored stuff where-ever possible.
