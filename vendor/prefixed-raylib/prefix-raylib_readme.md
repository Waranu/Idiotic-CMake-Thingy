# This is a fork of raylib with the pure goal of renaming functions to prevent name conflicts for people who otherwise can't get around it.

## All credit to the original work goes to Ramon "Ray" Santamaria and you should use his original project if possible.

### If you feel something else should be renamed you can let me know, open an issue, or prepare a PR.
